                  The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the
                  only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often
                  referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild
                  members of the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as
                  a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human
                  contact.[5] A house cat is valued by humans for companionship
                  and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are
                  recognized by various cat registries.

                  Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a
                  strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and
                  retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are
                  predators who are most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular).
                  Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
                  human ears, such as those made by mice and other small
                  animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they
                  see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell,
                  but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters,
                  are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of
                  vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                  growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body
                  language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving
                  pheromones.<br /><br />

                  Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late
                  autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.
                  Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed
                  cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the
                  breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as
                  abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral
                  cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird
                  species, and evoking population control.
